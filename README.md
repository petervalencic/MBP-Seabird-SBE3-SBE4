# Arduino Seabird SBE3 SBE4 

The project contains C/C++ code for Ardiuno Uno which is connected over custom made hardware shield to SBE-3 and SBE-4. The shield contains two comparators which are there to convert analog signal from SBE3 and SBE4 to TTL logic which then can be read with microcontroller.
